Credit Score Prediction Project
Overview
This project is aimed at predicting credit scores for individuals based on their financial and personal data. A credit score is a critical factor in determining an individual's creditworthiness and can impact their ability to secure loans, mortgages, and other financial products. By developing a credit score prediction model, we aim to provide valuable insights to financial institutions, lenders, and individuals.

Project Description

In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques, particularly a Random Forest Classifier, to predict credit scores. The Random Forest Classifier has proven to be effective in handling both numeric and categorical features, making it suitable for this task. We preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance to ensure accurate credit score predictions.


Data
Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. It contains personâ€™s credit-related information.

Data Preparation
Missing data handling: We addressed missing values in the dataset.


Modeling
We chose the Random Forest Classifier for its ability to handle complex datasets and provide feature importance insights. Key modeling steps include:

Usage

 To use this project for credit score prediction, follow these steps:

1. Data Preparation: Prepare your dataset in the same format as the training data, ensuring it undergoes the same preprocessing steps.

2. Model Loading: Load the trained Random Forest Classifier model (e.g., model.pkl) into your Python environment.

3. Prediction: Use the loaded model to make credit score predictions on your dataset.

4. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's predictions using relevant metrics and generate a classification report to assess its performance.
